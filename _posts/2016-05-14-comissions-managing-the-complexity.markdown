In the last post, I started talking about my actual work to simplify the management of **Sales Comissions** in **ERPNext**. After some ours of work, I presented the result to the customer. His answer was

- _That's amazing! But I fell that this don't can be able of cover all of my reality!_

We started discussing about what the **Sales Comission** project can't cover. So I understood that in some cases the the customer, will split the **Sales Comission** to multiple members of the _Team_, in other cases, the comission is directly affected by the _qty_ placed in the transaction. This seen a giant change, but in fact is only a small extension of the actual scenario! After 2 changes and 1 new field, this new reality can be covered by the *Sales Comission* project

The new field _fractionator_ indicated the field that is used as based to split the comission to the members of the _Team_.

The market segment of the customer is `Services` and these comissions are to **Sales Orders** placed as **Service Orders** where the service is directly connected with a Team that execute the **Service Order**. For some companies manage the **Services** as a **Project** is unreacheable or unmanageable.

So, at the end of this post all requirements of the customer was covered, and the most important, if we think a bit out of the box a single field can do a biggest change, and improve directly the management.

At final result, the comissions can be presented like the below image:
